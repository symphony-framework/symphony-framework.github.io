      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        Collaboration has been a key feature of the internet since its earliest days. The history of collaboration on
        the
        internet can be traced back to the 1960s, when Douglas Engelbart, the inventor of the computer mouse, <a href="https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19660020914/page/n1/mode/2up">studied</a>
        how
        computers could support collaborative work and communication. He developed a system called <a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/183/">
          NLS (oN-Line
          System)
        </a>
        that allowed users to create and edit documents, link them together, and share them with others.
      </p>
      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        Of course, for much of the internet’s history, collaboration had to be done by taking turns – collaborators
        might
        email a
        document back and forth after each round of changes, for example.
      </p>
      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        Even today, many online editing tools do not allow for concurrent changes by multiple users in real-time.
        <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>, for
        example, is an online collaboration platform that allows users to share and work on the same documents.
        What
        happens, though, when more than one user wants to edit a document at the same time?

        As the above image shows, online collaboration via Basecamp is not real-time–only one user is allowed to modify
        content
        at a time, and others must wait for that user to finish before making their own changes.

        Contrast that with applications such as Figma, Google Docs, Miro, and Trello that allow users to modify shared

        <strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> refers to the ability for multiple users to work on the same document

          Let’s illustrate this with a simple whiteboard application that we’ve created for demo purposes. Users can

          At this

        For an application to feature real-time collaboration, the first requirement is that data must be exchanged
        between
        users, or between users and a server, in real-time. Generally, that means that a user sees updated data either
        instantly
        or without noticeable delay, and without needing to take any specific action or make any particular request to
        see the
        updated data.

      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        For the purposes of real-time collaboration, data must flow in two directions: from the user, when that user

        change that will be shared with others, and to the user, when someone else makes a change.

      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        When building a real-time web application, challenges arise because HTTP, the protocol by which most web
        communication
        occurs, is not real-time by design. Instead, HTTP uses a request-response model whereby the client sends a
        request to a
        server and then waits for the server to respond with the requested data.

        So how can we make an application that lets users see a constant stream of updated data? For bi-directional,
        real-time
        data exchange over the web, two protocols in particular merit our consideration:
        <strong>WebRTC</strong> and <strong>WebSocket</strong>.

        <p class="casestudy-text">
          <strong>WebRTC</strong>, which stands for Web Real-Time Communication, is an open-source project that allows
          web browsers and mobile applications
          to engage in peer-to-peer real-time communication via APIs. The connection between peers is established with
          the use of
          a signaling server that acts as an initial intermediary, allowing two clients to find each other and negotiate
          connection parameters. Once the connection is established, data is transferred directly between the peers via
          media
          streams and/or data channels.

        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Since WebRTC is primarily used over UDP, it offers superior latency at the cost of some packet loss. This
          makes it an
          especially attractive choice for video and audio streaming.

      </div>
      <div id="subsection-2.2" class="subsection">
        <h3 class="subsection-heading" data-subsection="2.2">WebSocket</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          <strong>WebSocket</strong> is a protocol that provides a two-way channel of real-time communication between a
          client and a server. The connection
          is established via the WebSocket handshake:
        </p>
        <ul class="casestudy-list">
          <li class="casestudy-list-item">
            The client sends an HTTP request to the server with an <code>Upgrade</code> header

            The server responds with <code>Connection: Upgrade</code> and <code>Upgrade: Websocket</code> headers
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Once the handshake is complete, the WebSocket connection is established using the same underlying TCP/IP
          connection used
          in the handshake. Either party is now free to send data at any time via this connection.

          </video>
        </div>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          WebSocket provides better data integrity than WebRTC due to the underlying <a href="https://ably.com/topic/webrtc-vs-websocket#:~:text=While%20WebSocket%20works%20only%20over,the%20underlying%20reliability%20of%20TCP">reliability of TCP</a>, which provides

          detection, acknowledgement, and flow/congestion control mechanisms to ensure the accurate, complete, and
          in-order
          delivery of data. WebSocket is therefore often used in situations where delivering accurate data is
          paramount
          (e.g. real-time dashboards, stock price tickers) and where minimizing latency is less critical (e.g. live text
          chat).

          As we have seen, both WebRTC and WebSocket have trade-offs that make each better for some use cases and less
          suitable
          for others. When designing Symphony, we thought about which of these two technologies would be better for our
          use case.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Applications that would use Symphony are likely already using the <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/blog/client-server-architecture/">client-server model</a>, which lies at the heart
          of modern

        The answer is <strong>no</strong>. While the two users are exchanging information in real-time, they are not
        collaborating because they are not modifying
        the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">same state</a>. Each user has control only over his or her own messages, and each of these messages is
        independent
        of
        the others. Alice can see Bob’s messages in real-time, but she cannot modify them.

        This time, Alice and Bob are using an online word processor to work together on a document. Alice and Bob are
        each
        making their own changes, but they are viewing the same document, reflecting the modifications made by both
        users
        to
        that document, in real-time. Therefore we can say that there exists a</strong> between Alice and Bob.

      <p class="casestudy-text">
        This shared state, which is reflected in a single synchronized view presented to all users working on the same

          Collaboration is something that happens when two or more users work together on a specific document or
          project.
          We call
          this group of collaborating users, together with the shared state they are collaborating on, a
          <strong>room</strong>. This is consistent with the nomenclature <a href="https://liveblocks.io/docs/concepts#Room">favored by others</a> in this space including
          Liveblocks, a provider of real-time
          collaboration as a service:

        <p class="casestudy-text">
          A <strong><a href="https://docs.yjs.dev/">document</a></strong> is the shared state that users are collaborating on. Keep in mind that
          collaboration is <strong>not limited to text documents</strong>; a document could also be a JavaScript Map
          with key/value pairs that represent drawn objects on a whiteboard, for example.

        <h3 class="subsection-heading" data-subsection="3.2">Presence</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          When collaborating with others, it is useful to see not only the current state of the document but also which
          users are
          currently present and what they are doing at any given moment. Seeing what other users are doing in real-time
          makes for
          a smoother and more meaningful collaborative experience.
        </p>
        <div class="diagram">

        </div>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          We call this feature <strong>presence</strong>, which is the term most commonly used by other providers of
          real-time collaboration tools, including Liveblocks.
          In Symphony, each client sends an update to the server when some aspect of presence–cursor position for
          example–
          has
          changed. Which data to include in these presence updates, and the way that data is structured, is left to the
          application developer.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          It should be noted that presence data is distinct from the shared state (document) that is the subject of
          users’
          collaboration. Importantly, presence data is ephemeral and does not need to be persisted in the backend.

        <h3 class="subsection-heading" data-subsection="3.3">Undo/Redo</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Another concept worth discussing when it comes to collaborative applications is the ability of users to
          <strong>undo</strong> (and/or <strong>redo</strong>) their updates.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          When only a single user is editing, the concept of undo is simple: simply revert to the state immediately
          preceding the
          most recent change.
        </p>
        <div class="diagram">

        </div>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          However, when multiple users are making changes, the picture gets more complicated. If a user’s undo action
          simply
          returns the state to that immediately preceding that user’s last update, what happens to intervening updates
          by
          others?
        </p>
        <div class="diagram">

          wanted!
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          So going back to the state preceding the user’s change is not the answer. What we want instead is to make the
          undo/redo
          behavior user-specific, with the scope of these actions limited to the user’s own changes.

          the
          title at
          the same time. Next, Bob’s change is delivered to Alice, which overrides the state presented in her client–she
          now sees
          Bob’s version. Meanwhile, Alice’s change is delivered to Bob, which overrides his local state, and he is now
          shown
          Alice’s version. This means that Alice and Bob are out of sync, and we’ve lost the critical underpinning of
          real-time
          collaboration - a shared state.
        </p>

        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Another source of conflict in collaborative applications is out-of-order delivery of messages.

          Here, Alice makes two changes to the title, but due to network conditions the changes are delivered to Bob in
          reverse
          order. Bob’s state now reflects the first change, while Alice’s state reflects the second. Again, the users
          find
          themselves out of sync.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          It’s acceptable - even inevitable - for users to go out of sync temporarily, but we need some way of ensuring
          that they
          will eventually converge again to the same state. In the end, we want all users to see the same document
          on their
          screen, reflecting all the changes that have been made.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          So how can we deal with this problem? There are generally two families of algorithms that are used to resolve
          conflicts
          in collaborative applications.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mini-heading">Operational Transformation</h5>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          <strong>Operational transformation (OT)</strong> is the traditional technique to synchronize and reconcile
          concurrent changes to a shared data structure in real-time
          collaborative applications. When a user inserts or deletes data, that change is first sent to the server. The
          server
          then modifies, or transforms, that change if necessary, before sending it on to other users.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Used most famously by Google Docs, OTs are especially good for text editing of long documents with low memory
          and
          performance overhead. They do have downsides, however. They generally require that a user be connected to
          the
          server at all times, <a href="https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/real-time-collaboration-ot-vs-crdt/">limiting</a> the user’s ability to work offline and sync up later after connecting. Most
          importantly, they are <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">very hard to implement correctly</a>. It is difficult to deal with all edge cases, and
          many
          papers on OT implementations were found to have errors, years after publication.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          "Unfortunately, implementing OT sucks. There's a million algorithms with different tradeoffs, mostly

        <h5 class="mini-heading">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</h5>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          A <strong>Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)</strong> is a type of data structure that is designed to
          be
          replicated across multiple devices. CRDTs have mathematical
          properties that guarantee eventual consistency, even in the presence of concurrent, conflicting updates.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          A relatively new concept aiming to solve problems in distributed computing, <a href="https://exaspark.medium.com/top-5-ways-to-implement-real-time-rich-text-editor-ranked-by-complexity-3bc26e3c777f">

          resolving merge conflicts arising out of real-time collaboration, which can be seen as a kind of distributed
          system
          where state is shared across multiple clients.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Unlike OT, CRDTs do not make any assumptions about your network topology–they can be used in a strictly
          peer-to-peer
          environment, but also work <a href="https://exaspark.medium.com/top-5-ways-to-implement-real-time-rich-text-editor-ranked-by-complexity-3bc26e3c777f">perfectly well in a client-server model</a>.

        </blockquote>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Another key characteristic of CRDTs not shared by OT is partition fault tolerance. In a distributed system,
          network
          partitions can occur due to congestion or hardware failures. With CRDTs, even if two disconnected users update
          the same
          content concurrently, the updates will eventually merge when the partition is resolved.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Early CRDTs were found to be relatively slow compared to their <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/crdts-are-the-future/">OT counterparts</a>. Another potential
          downside is
          memory overhead, since every change to a document creates more data that must be retained to guarantee
          consistency.

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          "Because of how CRDTs work, documents grow without bound. … Can you ever delete that data? Probably not.

        <p class="casestudy-text">
          So which choice is best?
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          The first thing to point out is that there is no single best, one-size-fits-all solution to resolving merge
          conflicts.
          The best choice will, therefore, depend on the specific use case.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          For Symphony, we were looking for something that was open-source, well-documented, and performant. We also
          wanted a
          solution that would allow users to work offline. These factors led us to select CRDTs due to their robust
          open-source
          implementations, recent performance improvements, and tolerance for network partitions.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          For the specific CRDT implementation we chose <strong><a href="https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/yjs-webrtc-part-5">Yjs</a></strong>, a mature library with

        Now that we understand the ingredients of real-time collaboration, let’s place ourselves in the shoes of a
        developer who
        wishes to add real-time collaboration to an application. What kinds of functionality and infrastructure will we
        need?
      </p>
      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        First, we’ll want a WebSocket server or servers to receive updates from users and transmit those updates to
        other users
        who are in the same room.
      </p>
      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        Next, we’ll need a means of resolving merge conflicts.
      </p>
      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        Ideally, we will also have a way of persisting room state. When users leave a room, they probably don’t want to
        lose all
        of their work. Instead, they should be able to return later and pick up where they left off. This can be
        achieved by
        storing room state in a database when users disconnect, and retrieving that state from the database when they
        reconnect.
      </p>
      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        What if a user loses their internet connection but wants to continue working on a document? Wouldn’t it be nice
        if a
        user’s offline changes can be stored and then synced back up with others when the user reconnects? To enable
        this, we’ll
        want a way for each client to store state locally.
      </p>
      <p class='casestudy-text'>
        Finally, from the developer’s perspective, it could be useful to know how users are collaborating in an
        application. A
        developer dashboard might be one way of gaining visibility into metrics like the number of rooms, the number of
        users
        per room, and the size of the document associated with a given room.
      </p>
      <p class="casestudy-text">
        What then are the developer’s options for obtaining this functionality and related infrastructure?
      </p>

      <div id="subsection-4.1" class="subsection">
        <h3 class="subsection-heading" data-subsection="4.1">Do-It-Yourself (DIY)</h3>
        <p class='casestudy-text'>
          One option is for the developer to implement or source each of these components separately and stitch them
          together.
        </p>
        <p class='casestudy-text'>
          For the backend infrastructure to handle real-time messaging and persist state, one could use a
          backend-as-a-service
          such as Ably, Pusher, or PubNub, or alternatively deploy one’s own backend by provisioning resources on a
          cloud provider
          like AWS.
        </p>
        <p class='casestudy-text'>
          For conflict resolution, the developer would most likely need to research and integrate an existing
          open-source
          solution. She might even choose to implement a bespoke conflict resolution implementation, although this would
          be
          considerably more time-consuming and difficult.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          In sum, going the DIY route is less costly, but the implementation burden on the developer in terms of
          sourcing and
          integrating the needed components is higher than using one of the services described in the next section.

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            Fluid Framework is an open-source, cloud-agnostic framework for real-time collaboration, developed by
            Microsoft. For
            conflict resolution, it uses a distributed data structure that Microsoft describes as <a href="https://fluidframework.com/docs/faq/">
              “more similar to CRDT
              than OT”
            </a>. When deployed on a single server, Fluid Framework can handle hundreds of concurrent users. For
            larger
            applications, however,the developer will need to implement <a href="https://fluidframework.com/docs/faq/">her own scaling solution</a>. Another drawback of
            Fluid
            Framework is that it does not include support for offline editing, although short periods of client
            disconnection are
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-fluid-relay/resources/faqs">tolerated</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            While Fluid Framework itself is open-source and self-hosted, Microsoft also offers a managed service called

        <h3 class="subsection-heading" data-subsection="4.3">Where Does Symphony Fit In?</h3>
        <p class='casestudy-text'>
          We drew inspiration from both Liveblocks and Fluid Framework. Our goal was to build a framework that
          developers can
          easily integrate into existing applications to add real-time collaborative functionality. We also wanted to
          make
          Symphony available to developers free of charge as an open-source project, and to enable offline editing
          functionality
          so that developers could achieve a better experience for their users.
        </p>
        <p class='casestudy-text'>
          Additionally, we decided to implement a dashboard to address a couple of potential problems developers might
          face after
          deployment.
        </p>
        <p class='casestudy-text'>
          First, given the memory requirements of CRDTs and the considerable CPU demands placed on the server as it
          receives and
          propagates updates, system limits could be exceeded if not actively monitored. The dashboard provides
          developers with
          visibility into metrics such as number of rooms, sizes of documents stored in rooms, and numbers of
          connections per room
          that will help identify when and why performance problems occur.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Second, the dashboard can be used to view the current state of a room in JSON format. This can serve as a
          debugging tool
          when the developer’s application is not storing and modifying state as expected.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          In short, Symphony is aimed at developers of collaborative web applications who want to get real-time
          collaboration up
          and running quickly on a smaller budget.

        <h3 class="subsection-heading" data-subsection="5.1">Design Philosophy</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          When designing Symphony, our decisions were informed at every step of the way by the fundamental problem we
          aimed to
          address: that building collaborative applications where multiple users can change a given piece of state
          concurrently is
          difficult.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          With this in mind, we aimed to provide the infrastructure needed for creating conflict-free collaborative
          experiences on
          the web in a way that is easy for developers to drop into their existing applications.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          We wanted to abstract away the complexity of managing and scaling WebSocket connections, resolving merge
          conflicts, and
          persisting state so that developers would be free to focus on their applications.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Finally, we wanted the framework to provide capacity comparable to the highest level of Liveblocks’ Pro tier,
          which supports up to 25,000 monthly active users. Assuming 10%-30% of MAUs online at any given time, and
          choosing to err on the high side, we arrived at a goal of 8,000 concurrent active users.

        <h3 class="subsection-heading" data-subsection="5.2">Prototyping</h3>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          Our first goal when building Symphony was to create a basic prototype of the system. We chose to do this in
          AWS, which
          was a natural choice as the biggest player in the cloud provider market with 32% market share as of early
          2023.
        </p>
        <div id="subsection-5.2.1" class="subsection">
          <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" data-subsection="5.2.1">Deploying the WebSocket Server</h4>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            Since we are using the WebSocket protocol for real-time data transfer, we will need a WebSocket server to
            receive and
            distribute messages. And since we have chosen the Yjs CRDT implementation, our starting point for the
            Symphony backend
            was y-websocket, a reference WebSocket server that implements the <a href="https://github.com/yjs/y-websocket">Yjs protocols</a> for syncing updates and
            broadcasting
            presence. We deployed the server to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which is the standard virtual
            private
            server offered by AWS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="subsection-5.2.2" class="subsection">
          <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" data-subsection="5.2.2">Persisting and Retrieving Document Data</h4>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            When a collaboration session ends, users will likely want to come back later and continue where they left
            off. When they
            reconnect, where will the previous state come from? One or more users might have it stored locally, but that
            local data
            could be lost if they cleared their browser cache.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            Our next step was therefore to modify the server to persist document data to a database so that users would
            be able to
            leave a room without losing their work.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            The main decision points here were 1) where to persist the data and 2) when to persist the data. </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            For the storage location, we chose Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). S3 provides object storage, which is
            ideal for
            persisting large amounts of unstructured data such as our room documents. We also considered using a NoSQL
            database like
            Amazon DynamoDB, but found that S3 would be cheaper as the costs for storing a given amount of data are
            significantly
            lower in S3 compared to DynamoDB. S3 is also more practical for use cases like ours with unbounded document
            size, as the
            maximum size of a single item in DynamoDB is 400KB.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            As for when to store document data, we decided first of all to persist the data to S3 every 30 seconds. We
            felt that
            this struck an appropriate balance between minimizing the amount of data that would be lost in the event of
            server
            failure, and reducing demand on the server. This is also in line with the 30- to 60-second “checkpointing”
            interval <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/making-multiplayer-more-reliable/">
              used
              by Figma
            </a>.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            We also persist document data to S3 when the last user leaves the room. When no more users are collaborating
            on a
            document, we don’t want the server to have to keep the document data in memory. Therefore, to free up these
            resources,
            the server sends the data to S3 and unloads it from memory.

          </div>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            Finally, when a user connects to the server to collaborate in a given room, and the server does not have
            data for that
            room in memory, the server needs to query S3 for that data and retrieve it, if it exists.

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            Now we have a way of establishing WebSocket connections between users and the server, and a way to persist
            document data
            so that users don’t lose work when a collaboration session ends. Our developers, however, don’t have any
            good way of
            seeing how many rooms are active or how many users are connected at any given time. The next step is to give
            developers
            visibility into these metrics.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            To do this, we need to persist metadata about connections and rooms somewhere. A relational database is an
            appropriate
            choice since it will help ensure data integrity and enable flexible and efficient queries in this case since
            our data is
            structured. For that reason we chose a PostgreSQL database provisioned in Amazon Relational Database Service
            (RDS).

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            To access this room metadata, we added GET routes to the server. The dashboard sends HTTP requests to these
            routes, and
            the server responds with data such as the number rooms and connections per room that are used to populate
            the dashboard.
            For the number of connections for a given room, a continuous stream of data is sent from the server to the
            dashboard
            client via an SSE stream established via one of these GET routes.

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            We now have the basic components of the Symphony backend in place: a WebSocket server to exchange document
            updates with
            clients, an S3 bucket where document state is persisted, and a PostgreSQL database for storing metadata.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            The next step is to enable a web application to connect to this backend. For this, a client library is
            needed to
            communicate with the server in accordance with the Yjs library’s protocols for syncing document updates and
            broadcasting
            awareness. Since one of the goals of our project is to make adding real-time collaboration functionality as
            easy and
            painless as possible for the developer, we gave this library an API that emphasizes simplicity and
            intuitiveness.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            As was mentioned earlier, we want offline users to be able to continue working after disconnection and sync
            their
            changes later when they reconnect. This means that state needs to be stored locally, which also lies within
            the
            responsibility of the client library. In Symphony, user changes are written to IndexedDB in the browser
            before being
            sent to the server.

          <h4 class="subsubsection-heading" data-subsection="5.2.5">From EC2 to ECS</h4>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            With the server deployed to EC2, the developer remains responsible for managing the server–applying security
            updates,
            handling logs, etc. We wanted Symphony to abstract away this backend management from the developer, in line
            with our
            design philosophy of making an easy-to-use framework.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            With that in mind, we moved our architecture into AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), a fully managed
            container
            orchestration service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            To do this, we first had to containerize our application, and then reference that Docker container in an ECS
            task
            definition. The task definition is then referenced by a service definition which indicates how many
            instances of the
            container we want to run. ECS also gives you the choice of deploying in EC2 or Fargate mode. EC2 mode gives
            developers
            more granular control over container instances, at the cost of needing to manage instance configuration and
            updates.
            Since we wanted to abstract away this management from the developer, we chose Fargate.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            Now that we have a Symphony client as well as a dashboard client for developers accessing our backend, we
            want a single
            point of entry for both. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) that sits in front of our backend gives us this
            single point
            of entry, and also routes traffic to individual instances of our WebSocket server in the scaled form of our
            architecture, which will be discussed in a later section.

          Now that our prototype was up and running, we wanted to test how many users could connect to a single instance
          of the
          server at once, under as close to real-life conditions as possible. We also wanted to identify our server’s
          bottlenecks

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            We first needed a way to establish a large number of user connections, with each virtual user sending
            document updates
            and broadcasting presence. To do this, we wrote a Node.js script to spawn a separate process for each user
            connecting to
            the backend. Since creating multiple users and handling updates for those users is very demanding in terms
            of CPU, we
            provisioned multiple EC2 instances to run the script and connect to the backend concurrently.

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            For the test itself, we provisioned a single WebSocket server with 1vCPU and 4GB of memory. We configured
            our script to
            create 240 users with 4 users per room, giving us a total of 60 rooms. The test was run for 30 minutes.

            While the rates of document and presence updates could vary widely depending on the specific use case, we
            felt that
            these were reasonable values to simulate real-world usage (Liveblocks’ default settings throttle user
            updates to 10 per
            second, for comparison).
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            During the test, we observed CPU usage steadily climb as our virtual users connected to the backend. Once
            all
            connections were established, CPU usage had reached about 92%. This figure continued to slowly increase as
            the test went
            on, which we believe was due to the increased compute requirements as document sizes grew. After 30 minutes,
            CPU usage
            had reached 94% and we started to see dropped connections.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            These results indicate that for a modestly provisioned server with 1vCPU and 4GB of memory, our system can
            handle about
            240 concurrent users.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            It would be possible to increase the number of users by vertically scaling–provisioning a server with
            greater compute
            and memory capacity–but scaling up our system in this way would have downsides. First, the WebSocket server
            would
            continue to have a single point of failure. If that server goes down, the system becomes unavailable.
            Second, scaling
            would be hard-capped by the maximum server size offered by AWS.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            For these reasons we decided to explore horizontally scaling, which means increasing the number rather than
            the size of
            our servers. This would make our system capable of handling more users, while also being more resilient to
            server
            failures.

            This is not a problem unique to the Symphony backend. One common pattern for scaling WebSockets is to have
            each server
            connect to Redis channels: to a “publish” channel to send all updates received by the server from users, and
            to a
            “subscribe” channel to receive all updates published by other servers. In this way, we can scale our servers
            horizontally and they will be able to receive all updates they need for their connected users. Indeed, this
            is how
            <a href="https://github.com/yjs/y-redis">existing attempts</a> to scale Yjs backends with Redis, such as y-redis, have worked.

          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            When a server receives an incoming connection for a given room for the first time, it doesn’t just need to
            receive all <strong>future</strong> updates to that room’s state. It also needs to somehow get all
            <strong>previous</strong> updates to state. If we’re using the traditional Redis pub/sub approach, this
            means that every server needs to subscribe
            to Redis for every document, and needs to hold every document in memory, to ensure that the state is there
            when it needs
            it–when a user connects and starts collaborating on that state. In other words, we haven’t actually done
            anything to
            reduce the memory demands on our servers.

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            What if we could design the system in such a way that servers don’t need to hold all documents in memory–but
            instead,
            only the documents for which they have connected users? In that case, when a server receives a connection
            for a room for
            the first time, it would need to get the current document data from somewhere.

          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            One idea that came to mind was to allow servers to query each other for that initial state. In this way, a
            server
            receiving a new connection could get “up to speed” so to speak on the current state of the document, and
            then subscribe
            to Redis for all future updates.

          <p class="casestudy-text">
            If a server is going to get document data from another server, the next question is, how does it know which
            server to
            query? We would need to store data–room names and IP addresses–indicating which rooms are being handled by
            which
            servers.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            For this we chose AWS DynamoDB, a serverless NoSQL key-value database. While it might seem tempting to use
            Redis for both the pub/sub messaging system and the IP address data store, we decided against it. By using
            DynamoDB we could separate those concerns, leading to a cleaner architecture and preventing a potential
            overloading of Redis with multiple responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            When a user is routed to a server that does not have the relevant document in memory, the server queries
            DynamoDB with
            the room name.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            If DynamoDB returns an empty set, it means that there aren’t any servers currently handling that room. In
            this case, the
            server queries S3 to get persisted data for the room, if any, and then publishes/subscribes to Redis for
            updates to that
            room.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            If DynamoDB returns a set containing one or more server IP addresses, the server sends a GET request to the
            first IP
            address in the set. The responding server sends the current state of the document, and the requesting server
            then
            publishes/subscribes to Redis as usual. Note that in this case, our requesting server does not query S3 for
            persisted
            data. This is because another server is currently handling the room, meaning that S3 will not have the most
            recent
            state.
          </p>
          <p class="casestudy-text">
            In either case, the server’s IP address is added to the DynamoDB set for that room name, registering it as
            one of the
            servers that can now be queried for the room’s state.

            number, and

          for.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          For consistency and comparability, we used the same parameters as when we tested the single-server prototype:
          four
          virtual users per room, five presence updates per user per second, and one document update per user per
          second. Each
          server within the ECS cluster was provisioned with 1vCPU and 4GB of memory, matching the specifications used
          during
          single-server testing.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          First, we ran a test with 1,000 virtual users. We observed the number of WebSocket instances scaling out as
          expected,
          and the system appeared capable of handling this number of users. As soon as we tried to push the number of
          users a
          little higher to 1,200, however, instances started to fail.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          The culprit turned out to be the routing algorithm used by our ALB. By default, the ALB uses a round-robin
          algorithm in
          which requests are routed to each instance in turn without any consideration for how much each instance is
          being
          utilized. In our case, that meant that even if one instance had 90% CPU utilization and another had 10%, both
          instances
          were receiving an equal number of new connections, causing the first instance to eventually fail.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          The solution was to configure the ALB to use a least-outstanding-requests algorithm, which routes incoming
          requests to
          the instance with the least number of outstanding requests, taking the load off overloaded servers.
        </p>
        <p class="casestudy-text">
          We ran our test again with 1,200 virtual users, and saw no issues this time. We then continued adding users
          and at 10,000 virtual users, CPU utilization for the cluster remained near the 50 percent target, without any
          server failures observed.

          One design pattern we’ve noticed in the real-time collaborative space is what we’ll call the “single room per
          container”
          design. In this approach, each instance of the WebSocket server is responsible for only a single room, and all
          users for
          a given room are routed to the same server. Figma, a collaborative web application for interface that uses a
          custom-built WebSocket backend and conflict resolution mechanism, appears to use this pattern.

          A possible advantage of this approach might be improved CPU and memory efficiency. If all traffic for a given
